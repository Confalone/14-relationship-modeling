* Submit on canvas:
  * a question and observation
  * how long you spent
  * link to your pull request
  * link to your build at travis-ci URL
  * Heroku Server URL

## Configuration 
Configure the root of your repository with the following files and directories. Thoughfully name and organize any aditional configuration or module files.
* **README.md** - contains documentation
* **.env** - contains env variables (should be git ignored)
* **.gitignore** - contains a [robust](http://gitignore.io) `.gitignore` file 
* **.eslintrc** - contains the course linter configuratoin
* **.eslintignore** - contains the course linter ignore configuration
* **.travis.yml** - contains the course linter ignore configuration
* **package.json** - contains npm package config
  * create a `lint` script for running eslint (eslint **/*.js)
  * create a `test` script for running tests
  * create a `start` script for running your server
* **index.js** - the entry point for your application
* **src/** - contains your core application files and folders
* **src/app.js** - (or main.js) contains your core application bootstrap
* **src/lib/** - contains module definitions
* **\_\_test\_\_/** - contains unit tests

## Learning Objectives  
* students will be able to create a 2 resource MongoDB and Express API
* students will be able to reference additional resources as part of their mongoose.js based data models
* students will be able to use the `populate` method to allow for resource query population

## Requirements

#### Feature Tasks
  * continue working on the `express` and `mongoDB` REST API that you started yesterday
  * include an additional resource that contains a "relationship" to the single resource that has already been created
  * create `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes for your newly added resource
  * test your application to ensure that it meets the standard criteria of a working **full CRUD** REST API
  * use `populate` in the `get()` route logic your  `/api/new-resource-name/:id` route to populate the associated property used to house related resources **(ex: `List.findById(req.params.id).populate('notes')`)**

# Lab 13 - Relationship Modeling
## Models

### Team Model

### Properties
  * `name ` (required)
  * `mascot`
  * `location` (required)

## Server Endpoints
### `/api/v1/team`
* `POST` request
  * should pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a post request to create a new team
### `api/v1/team`
* `GET` request
* Fetch all teams
### `/api/v1/team/:id`
* `GET` request
  * should pass the id of a team through the url endpoint to get a specific team
* `PUT` request
  * should pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a put request to overwrite a pre-existing team
* `DELETE` request
  * should pass the id of a team though the url endpoint to delete a specific team

### Tests
 * `GET` - test 200, returns a resource with a valid body
 * `GET` - test 404, respond with 'not found' for valid requests made with an id that was not found
 * `PUT` - test 200, returns a resource with an updated body
 * `PUT` - test 400, responds with 'bad request' if no request body was provided
 * `PUT` - test 404, responds with 'not found' for valid requests made with an id that was not found
 * `POST` - test 400, responds with 'bad request' if no request body was provided
 * `POST` - test 200, returns a resource for requests made with a valid body
